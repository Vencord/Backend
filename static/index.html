<h1>Vencord API</h1>
<p>
    This is the API used by Vencord features like Settings Sync. If you are
    wondering why requests are sent here, it's because you explicitly opted into
    Settings Sync. You can disable it at any point!
</p>
<p>
    But no worries, this api
    <a href="/basic-privacy-policy">takes your privacy serious</a> and is
    <a href="https://github.com/Vencord/Backend">free and open source!</a>
</p>
